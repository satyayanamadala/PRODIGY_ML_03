# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This is **Task-03** for the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. The project demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for binary image classification between **cats** and **dogs** based on extracted image features.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
- Folder used: `train/` containing images like `cat.0.jpg`, `dog.0.jpg`
- Target labels: `cat`, `dog`

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (SVM)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
2. **Image Resizing and Flattening**
3. **Feature Scaling**
4. **Model Training using SVM**
5. **Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)**
6. **Prediction & Visualization**
